# Frontend Mentor - QR code component

![Design preview for the QR code component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

I just recently worked on this challenge through Frontend Mentor.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML and CSS.**

## The challenge

The challenge was to build a QR code component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

I used a bit of bootstrap, and google fonts.

## Where to find everything

The designs are inside the `/design` folder. There is both mobile and a desktop version of the design.

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`.

If you would like the design files (we provide Sketch & Figma versions) to inspect the design in more detail, you can [subscribe as a PRO member](https://www.frontendmentor.io/pro).
I am only using the free version.

All the required assets are in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information, such as color palette and fonts.
